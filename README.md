## Data Preprocessing Techniques

In machine learning, preprocessing techniques are essential for ensuring data quality and improving model performance. Below are the techniques applied in this project:

### 1. Data Cleaning

#### Handling Missing Values
- **Imputation**: Filling missing values with mean, median, mode, or using more sophisticated techniques.
- **Deleting rows/columns**: Removing rows or columns with excessive missing values.

#### Outlier Detection and Removal
- **Z-score method**: Identifying outliers based on Z-scores.
- **IQR method**: Using the Interquartile Range to detect outliers.

#### Dealing with Duplicates
- **Removing duplicate rows**: Ensuring the dataset has unique entries.

### 2. Feature Scaling
- **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)**: Scaling data to a fixed range, typically [0, 1].
- **Standardization (Z-score Scaling)**: Centering data around the mean with a standard deviation of 1.
- **Robust Scaling**: Using the median and IQR to scale data, useful for datasets with outliers.

### 3. Encoding Categorical Variables
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Creating binary columns for each category.
- **Label Encoding**: Assigning a unique integer to each category.
- **Ordinal Encoding**: Converting ordered categorical data to numeric values.
- **Binary Encoding**: A combination of one-hot and label encoding for high-cardinality features.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- **Feature Selection**: Removing irrelevant or redundant features using correlation analysis or mutual information.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reducing the number of features while retaining variance.
  - **LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)**: Maximizing class separability.
- **Feature Extraction**: Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., polynomial features).
- **Binning (Discretization)**: Converting continuous variables into discrete bins.

### 5. Data Transformation
- **Log Transformation**: Reducing skewness in highly skewed data.
- **Box-Cox Transformation**: A generalized transformation for stabilizing variance.
- **Power Transformation (Yeo-Johnson)**: Similar to Box-Cox but handles negative values.

### 6. Data Augmentation
- **Image Data**: Techniques like rotating, flipping, zooming, and cropping.
- **Text Data**: Synonym replacement, random insertion, deletion, or swapping of words.

### 7. Handling Imbalanced Data
- **Resampling Techniques**:
  - **Oversampling**: Increasing minority class samples (e.g., SMOTE).
  - **Undersampling**: Reducing majority class samples.
- **Class Weight Adjustment**: Assigning higher weights to the minority class during training.

### 8. Text Preprocessing (for NLP)
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or sentences.
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all characters to lowercase.
- **Removing Stopwords**: Eliminating common words that don't add meaning.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form.
- **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their base form considering context.
- **Removing Punctuation, Numbers, or Special Characters**: Cleaning non-alphabetical elements.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Converting text into numeric vectors based on word importance.

### 9. Time Series Preprocessing (for Time Series Data)
- **Resampling**: Changing the frequency of the time series data.
- **Rolling Statistics**: Calculating moving averages or other rolling statistics.
- **Differencing**: Removing trends by stabilizing the mean.

### 10. Data Transformation (For Specific Types of Data)
- **Log Transformation**: Applied to skewed data for normalization.
- **Square Root or Cube Root Transformation**: Applied to moderate skewness.

### 11. Handling Sequence Data (for NLP or other time-dependent data)
- **Padding**: Making sequences of different lengths uniform.
- **Truncation**: Shortening sequences that are too long.
